# ascii-chords
Script to generate ASCII chord diagrams, as well as a collection of generated diagrams

The primary goal of this project is to develop a script that can convert from a "numerical" notation of a chord to an ASCII image. Below is a sample:


**Chord:**
G Major Chord

**Simple "Numerical" Format:**
320003

**Proposed "ASCII Chord" Format:**

```
	e A D G B E
  	-----------
1 |	. . . . . .
2 |	. X . . . .
3 |	X . . . . X
4 |	. . . . . .
5 |	. . . . . .
```
